VirtualInput
======

This is a simple virtual input library for Unity3D that lets you easily create virtual joysticks / buttons on the screen for use in touch interface games.

It tries to emulate Unity's builtin "Input" API as much as possible. You should be able to get a joystick and buttons up and running with very little learning involved.
